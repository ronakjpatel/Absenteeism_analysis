## Aim
The main aim of this project is to perform the  Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the dataset to deepen my knowledge about the various industry accepted EDA methods.

*Project Glimpse*


## Motivation

Often, I was ignoring the importance of EDA in the data science project from the beginning until I came across a couple of articles, such as [IBM Learning hub](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/exploratory-data-analysis), a great post by [Jaideep](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/exploratory-data-analysis-and-its-importance-to-your-business/). After giving careful consideration, I convinced myself that the importance of the EDA is paramount. Therefore, I started exploring the multitude of EDA methods and techniques. Consequently, I determined to create a project to solidify my knowledge having believed that poor understanding of the EDA could lead the data science project findings in the wrong direction.   

## Installation

You need to install R language and RStudio (IDE) before using this project's .rmd (R Markdown) file. 

1. To install R on your computer follow the below link 

- [R and RStudio Installation in Windows](https://owi.usgs.gov/R/training-curriculum/installr/)
- [R and RStudio Installation in Mac](https://web.stanford.edu/~kjytay/courses/stats32-aut2018/Session%201/Installation%20for%20Mac.html)

2. The code is written in the R markdown file (.rmd) which is similar to the Jupyter notebook in python. 
 
Why R Markdown ?

> R Markdown (. Rmd) is an authoring format that enables easy creation of dynamic documents, presentations, and reports from R. It combines the core syntax of markdown (an easy to write plain text format) with embedded R code chunks that are run so their output can be included in the final document. -[ R Studio Documentation](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)

3. Open up the .rmd file in the RStudio. 


## Challenges
- Learning the R language and its packages.
- Too many variables in the dataset.
- Determining the importance of the specific variables.
- Deciding about what to keep and what to remove.
- Utilizing various statistical methods to find out the ideal choice of the clusters within the data.

## Outcome
:medal_military: I have developed my EDA skills and taken them to the next level along with the R language knowledge. I have gained a comprehension of the advanced machine learning and statistical learning techniques used in typical ML projects.
